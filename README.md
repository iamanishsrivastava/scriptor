# Scriptor - Script-to-Voice Transcriptor

**Scriptor** is a powerful tool that helps convert scripts into voices using a backend-driven, scalable architecture built on **Next.js**, **Prisma**, and **PostgreSQL**.

This project is designed to be a **full-stack application** with a focus on **AI-driven** features, allowing users to create, manage, and transcribe scripts and voices efficiently.

## üöÄ Features

- **Convert scripts to voices**: The application will eventually allow converting scripts into voices using cutting-edge technologies such as Large Language Models (LLMs), Distillation techniques, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based methods. These technologies will improve the system‚Äôs ability to understand and process text contextually and generate human-like voice outputs.
- **Voice to script transcription**: Allows the system to transcribe audio back into text, enabling a seamless flow between voice and written script, powered by AI-driven transcription models.
- **AI-driven enhancements**: In the future, I will integrate LLMs or RAG-based technologies to empower the script-to-voice and voice-to-script processes, ensuring context-aware conversions that are more accurate and natural. This will enable the platform to handle diverse input and generate outputs that feel more human, efficient, and adaptable.

## üõ† Technologies

- **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router for routing and layout)
- **Backend**: Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL for structured database access
- **State Management**: Managed via Prisma Client for seamless DB interaction
- **Authentication**: Custom Auth API endpoints (JWT/session-based)
- **Testing**: Jest, Supertest, Zod validation, Prisma Test Suite
- **AI Integration**: Planned LLMs, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), or distillation-based models
- **Dev Tools**: ESLint, Prettier, Husky (pre-commit hooks), Git branching conventions
- **Deployment**: Vercel or similar serverless-compatible platforms
- **Environment Management**: .env with dotenv support for secrets/configs

<summary>üõ† Installation (Click to expand)</summary>

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16.0+ (or LTS version)
- PostgreSQL
- Prisma CLI (`npx prisma`)

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamanishsrivastava/scriptor.git
cd scriptor
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

- Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the required values.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 4. Set up the database

- Create a PostgreSQL database and update the `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file. For ref. [PR7](https://github.com/TezBytes/scriptor/pull/7#issue-3054477033)
- Run the following command to create the database and apply migrations:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

### 5. Seed the database (optional)

- If you want to seed the database with initial data, run:

```bash
npx prisma db seed
```

### 6. Start the development server

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

- Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app in action.

## üß™ Running Tests

<details>
<summary>üß™ Running Tests (Click to expand)</summary>

- To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
pnpm test
```

- This will run all the tests in the `__tests__` directory and generate a coverage report.
- You can also run tests for specific files or directories by specifying the path:

```bash
pnpm test src/components/Button.test.tsx
```

- For more advanced testing options, refer to the [Jest documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/cli).
- You can also run the tests in watch mode for continuous testing during development:

```bash
pnpm test --watch
```

- This will watch for file changes and re-run the tests automatically.

## üîë Authentication

The API uses a custom authentication system, where users must sign up and log in to access features like script creation and project management. Passwords are securely hashed before being stored in the database.

- JWT tokens are used for authentication, and they should be included in the `Authorization` header of requests to protected endpoints.
- The token should be in the format `Bearer <token>`.
- Ensure to handle token expiration and refresh tokens as needed.
- The authentication middleware checks for the presence of a valid token before allowing access to protected routes.
- You can use the `useAuth` hook in the frontend to manage authentication state and access user information.
